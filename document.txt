name is also need for form dropdown

solving datatables: used get() in sql to get the object -> then in controller that object is changed to array I think using result() 
and then used -> to get the data out of it. Check teacher class for fetch teacher. Also have to add draw, record total and record filtered
$draw is used by data table to handle it correctly.

Using . operator to pass data in javascript check it:
onclick="removeTeacher('.$r->teacher_id.')"

data coming as ajax reponse is in string so change it to object:
  obj = JSON.parse(response);
                    if(obj.success == true){
                        $("#message").html('<p>' + obj.message+ '</p>');     
                    }

type can be found out be jQuery.type(obj);
